# Learned - Topics

## I Will Be Adding Different Topics Here As I Explored
```
1. Installation
2. Project Structure
3. Components
4. Angular Data Binding
    1. one way data binding -> interpolation, property binding, event binding
    2. two way data binding -> ngModel
5. Angular Directives
    1. Component
    2. Attribute -> ngClass, ngStyle, ngModel
    3. Structural -> ngIf-else, ngSwitch, ngFor
    4. Custom Directive
6. Services in Angular
7. Angular Routing
8. Angular Form
    1. Event Driven Forms (uses ngModel for 2 way data binding)
    2. Reactive Forms (Reactive Form Modules)
        1. Build using FormGroups
        2. Build using FormBuilder
    3. To build above 2 forms we need different Form Directives
9. Angular Form Validation
    1. Form States
        1. Value Changed - > pristine, Dirty
        2. Validity -> Valid, inValid -> return error collection

# MyFirstProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
